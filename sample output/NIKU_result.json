  "restaurant_summary": " The service was impeccable, the food was top notch and the ambience was a very upscale date night vibe . Everything was superb, can you believe this is an AYCE Wagyu restaurant! The food was very low quality, the service was super slow, and the price was really too high for what you get ."
